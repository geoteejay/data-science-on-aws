-1,An absolutely gorgeous  but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.,Blouses
-1,I just can't get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo. mine has dark colors  really dark colors.  this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide. i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large. i liked the length and the fact that it's shorter than shown. it still covered my bum.  the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back. i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,Blouses
-1,"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer  but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest  but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10""  140#  34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted  and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",Blouses
-1,The beadwork is gorgeous  but the sleeves are so puffy  it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.,Blouses
-1,Loved the fit and colors  but the fabric is very thin and see-thru. i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible. it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to.,Blouses
-1,This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large  it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.,Blouses
-1,I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,Blouses
-1,I wish this shirt would not have had so much material. it would make a great maternity top! if you are really thin  it might work for you too.,Blouses
-1,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off. the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine. if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large. would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders  arms and chest. such a shame since i really love the shirt.,Blouses
0,The positive: light-weight fabric  interesting drape  the negative: i'm tall and would have preferred if it was longer. the big drawback is the ridiculous buttons--three fell off the first time i wore it...and it fits loosely! they're held on by a single loop...ugh.,Blouses
0,This top is not for a curvy figure. the embroidered part is gorgeous  very stunning  but the loose bottom part is awful. i am curvy and usually wear l or xl. this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom  made me feel like i had a big tummy  and was a tad short. i am sending this back. this would look better on a more slender frame.,Blouses
0,"The fabric is wonderful  flows nicely and soft. i am 5'7""  145lbs and usually wear between a s and m. i ordered a s in this due to the majority of reviews and found it to fit my shoulders well and length was fine. after reading the reviews i was so excited to get it but for me it actually made me look larger. there was too much material for me on the bottom and it actually made me look like i had a ""pooch""  never a good thing. i thought of returning for a m as i thought maybe it would have hung",Blouses
0,Frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top. i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out. but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy. and it has an attached camisole  but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap. so i don't even know what to wear under it. it's going back  even with the sale price.,Blouses
0,This shirt is really cute but a little stiff. it does come with a slip  but the slip was tight  but the shirt fit  maybe even a little big. i used another cami under which was better. i think think the sizing is off in terms of slip vs. the actual shirt. i got it in the store with the 30% off  so it was a good deal. it does stretch out as you wear it  so it will get bigger and it did make me look a little bigger  but still cute on and for a summer shirt  it's thin  so it does work well in that r,Blouses
0,"I really liked the look of this top online  but when it came i had a couple of issues with it. first  when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug (i normally wear a 10/m  and that's what i ordered). it makes raising my arms tough  and as a teacher  i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist. secondly  my husband's first reaction was that it ""looks like pajamas."" the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost.  on the other hand  the color palette is very pretty and the qual",Blouses
0,I wanted to love this top but couldn't. i am curvy (36/27/39; 32dd) and this accentuated my hips (which is not needed) and made my chest/whole shape seem boxy. i could only recommend this top to someone who is smaller chested with a straight build- the bottom would help give some shape; pleating on front would help chest seem larger. i did love the color and construction  lace details  3/4 sleeves.,Blouses
0,Cropped and wide- would look cuter on someone who is more petite. was too wide and cropped for me. very sheer.,Blouses
0,First off  this shirt is a hd in paris brand  not floreat. i love floreat clothing so that is why i initially bought this blouse. i like the idea and the coloring of the shirt. the biggest drawback for me was that it is completely see through. i just bring myself to get a strapless cami just to wear this one top. please change brand name.,Blouses
1,"Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4""  125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy  which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!",Blouses
1,This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,Blouses
1,This is a great piece  which has flow  grace  and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time.,Blouses
1,Wish i had snagged both styles of this shirt before they sold out. this is a very cute  work appropriate top - good weight and quality to the shirt. i wear a lot of black and white at work (so sick of gray..why are all business clothes gray?) and this top will be added into my regular rotation.,Blouses
1,I found the material a little stiff  im asummig linen is stiff at first. i got an xxs and fit tts in my case (34 b  5'7  120 lb).,Blouses
1,This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it  is the three buttons in the back at the top are very  very difficult to button.,Blouses
1,This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however  regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely  but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good  although as someone else here commented  it is a stunning shade of pink  very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l,Blouses
1,I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.,Blouses
1,This top is really cute for the right body shape.  it is tight around the bust area if you select your size and sizing - you lose the shape.,Blouses
-1,After readying the reviews of this dress  i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy  was i wrong! first  this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall  the entire dress was not flattering. honestly  i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.,Dresses
-1,"I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago.  i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress.   the fit and style of this dress is wonderful  it's the color that killed it for me.   i ordered the ""orange"" because i liked the photo on the model.  when the dress arrived in the mail  i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on.   the color is almost neon orange.   too much for this redhead.  hard to wear that bright neony color.  not sure",Dresses
-1,I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining  but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk  instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well  but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes!     i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,Dresses
-1,I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!,Dresses
-1,I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,Dresses
-1,When i saw this online  i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw  the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it: ___________ pros: - the colors you see online are exactly the same in person. - the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh,Dresses
-1,This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side  not the front. very unflattering on me.,Dresses
-1,I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi  feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.,Dresses
-1,So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.,Dresses
0,This was the dress i was most excited about in the new arrivals  but sadly it didn't live up to expectations. unlike the first two product photos  the dress is baggy and empire waisted  and the black trim is the thin one shown in the last two product photos. the dress is slip on with no zipper or tie  and on me there were about 4+ inches to spare at the waist. all in all it felt sloppy  such a shame as i would have loved the original design online.    anyhow  i wanted to share photos of the real,Dresses
0,Contrary to some of the reviews posted the dress is not excessively sheer. you can't see black underwear thru the fabric  but you can see the body's silhouette in front of a light source. it's not lingerie sheer  but more like a medium weight gauze (without the wrinkles). if you're older or modest the sheerness may bother  otherwise (due to the print) it shouldn't be much of a factor.    now on to the size... i'm a plus size girl (size 18) and based on reviews saying the dress was huge  i ordere,Dresses
0,"I wanted to love this dress so much  but unfortunately it ran way too big for my taste. i am usually a 4/6 in retailer  and the small was huge on me. the bottom half of the dress is very much a ""swing"" dress and is very wide  much wider than it looks in the pictures. i suppose that sizing down (maybe even to a petite)  and having the dress altered to be narrower on the bottom half would've made it look like the picture  but that's a lot of extra work for a dress that is already pretty pricey.",Dresses
0,Really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit. fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me.,Dresses
0,When i received the dress i went to try it on and one of the loops for the string to cinch the dress broke. guess that's gonna have to go back,Dresses
0,This is a comfortable sweater dress  and the quality of the material seems good. the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland. i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf. i decided to pass.,Dresses
0,I ordered a size 4  my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso  but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy.,Dresses
0,The fabric felt beautiful  and it felt great on  but once i looked in the mirror it just looked too housedress like. maybe because it runs large. the price seemed high as well. i wanted to love it but i had to return.,Dresses
0,I usually wear a small  4 or 6 and in this dress i couldn't even zip up the 8. so tight in the rib cage and chest. if i tried to go up even further the bottom half got much bigger. guess this one is not for me.,Dresses
1,I really wanted to love this dress  but even though i got a small  it was still too big. i also don't think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me  other than that  it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice.,Dresses
1,Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size,Dresses
1,I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!,Dresses
1,Even though this is an online exclusive  i was able to try on a one off in the store. i have been looking for a cross front dress and the other option currently at retailer (the black and white striped top version) in a similar length) looked awkward. this dress looks great on but i needed the xs. i usually wear a 2. it was cute and i came online to see if the xs was available but it is sold out. the dress would be perfect if it had pockets!,Dresses
1,I love this dress. i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store  in fact i went right past it. however  when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable. i immediately tried it on and loved it. i think it runs really big. i am normally a size 8/athletic build and i bought the x-small. i small also fit but was a bit too baggy. most tops/dresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true,Dresses
1,I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on  is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.,Dresses
1,This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops  sandals  wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.,Dresses
1,Love this dress.  i like that it is somewhat form fitting but also has a nice swing to it.  green color is nice for summer.  bought a similar maeve dress last year and it was all cotton like and soft  this one has a soft top but a different material on the bottom.  a little scratchy and crinkly.  wish the entire thing was as soft as the top,Dresses
1,Tried this dress in two different sizes and just couldn't get a god fit for me. i found the upper arms a little snug and unforgiving if you don't have slim arms. it is a beautiful dress in person  probably more so than in the photos  and a nice thick quality feel. it didn't work on my frame  but i definitely recommend you give it a try.,Dresses
-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.,Fine gauge
-1,Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far  but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?,Fine gauge
-1,"The color of the sweater is beautiful  but the fit was awful. it was too ""swingy"" and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly  (i'm 5'1""  108lbs). i will be unfortunately returning this item.",Fine gauge
-1,It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline  but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.,Fine gauge
-1,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,Fine gauge
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge
-1,"This is a very pretty sweater  a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",Fine gauge
-1,I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately  it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.,Fine gauge
-1,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,Fine gauge
0,This sweater is thicker and darker than it appears online. i thought it would be more of a blush color  but it's more dark gray and brown. it wasn't that flattering on me as a cardigan. looked a little cuter all buttoned up  but ultimately i am not keeping because of the color.,Fine gauge
0,On the mannequin this looked adorable. it is made well but if you have any bustline it just billows out below like a tent and is not flattering. if it had less fullness it would have been really cute.,Fine gauge
0,This is a relatively cute top when you try it on. however  i don't think it will hold it's shape after even just 1 wear. it also doesn't seem like you could wash it without ruining it (like a shirt form a 'throw-away' cheap clothing store). i checked the fabric tag and it is a very high % viscose - meaning  it won't last long at all. i'm returning and feel frustrated with how cheap the fabric is.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.,Fine gauge
0,Very boxy top  not flattering on. i will be returning.,Fine gauge
0,Was excited about this sweater but it really didn't wow me when i put it on. the v-neck is quite low and the sweater is a bit short. loved the ideas of the fringe but in the end  it went back.,Fine gauge
0,Sooooo soft! not a ton of shape but very versitile and warm!,Fine gauge
0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5""  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",Fine gauge
0,Snags very very easily.  i hadent even gotten to take the tags off and it rubbed against another item and snagged! so disappointed as it is a beautiful top  lovely color and beautifully detailed! i'm so disappointed i was hoping to keep it but will be sending it back.,Fine gauge
1,I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.,Fine gauge
1,This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted  less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer  but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic.,Fine gauge
1,I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan  that i've had for years  was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged  so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill  with a perfect fit and lovely texture  making it not just your average sweater  to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!,Fine gauge
1,I am always a fan of retailer cardigans  but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art  especially the back and the color  i chose the green  is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed  go for it!,Fine gauge
1,I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent,Fine gauge
1,Very comfortable and attractive pullover. not too long or bulky  although i find myself rolling the sleeves up to keep them out of the way!  but it's a keeper,Fine gauge
1,I purchased this sweater in grey to take on a fall european trip. it is very pretty without being overly frilly. a marled heather grey color. soft and warm without being too bulky. light enough to wear in the daytime but with enough coverage to transition into a cool evening. casual enough to wear over a tee or blouse with jeans yet sleek enough to pair with a skirt or dress. it is a roomy fit without being sloppy. i like things a bit loose and comfy - not too tight and am happy with the medium,Fine gauge
1,I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine  one arm is a darker blue tie-dye  the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much  so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey  but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday  put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans  out to dinner we went!,Fine gauge
1,I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft  but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top  but otherwise a winner all around.,Fine gauge
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay  but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store  i would have passed over it. however  i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies  though!,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
-1,3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,Intimates

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,Got this in the mail today and while the design is cute  it's not as soft and comfortable as i would like. the front clasp takes a bit of practice to get on and off. the straps are a bit thin and hurts a bit.,Intimates
0,I have been eyeing this piece for months now! i broke down and bought it when they finally had my size in stock. i am 5 '4 and 110 lbs and have a very small chest so i ordered an xs. i think the top is too baggy for me. yes  the top and bottoms fit overall  but it doesn't look as nice and form fitting like it does on the model. it is very sheer--which is the thing that discourages me the most. i love the concept of this piece but the execution could use some work  which i am willing to work on s,Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,This is a very nice bra  upset though because this is the second time i have ordered something from retailer and the place that the product was made was incorrect on the website. bra was made in peru and website said usa. makes it very hard to be socially responsible on this website. not sure i will continue to shop retailer in the future because of this.,Intimates
0,It is a very pretty bra. light weight and beautiful lace. however  i have yet to find a t-back that does not make me feel like i am going to spill out. to me it ran small. i now know to get a 34 instead. i am working on losing weight  perhaps that might help with the fit?,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,When ordering this product  i thought it was strange that the mediums were sold out. i went with the small which is generally what i wear. however  these run small and i see why the medium ran out. they are pretty  however  i wish they made them more true to size.,Intimates
1,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.,Intimates
1,I got these pretty boy shorts because i was looking for a panty that was comfy for bedtime--pretty but with a fair amount of coverage. i am really happy with them. wonderful with a tank top or chemise. i think the ruffles are a bit bulky for skinny jeans  but i love them for sleeping. they feel special.,Intimates
1,Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker  i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences  and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty  and this one fits  it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind  the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie ,Intimates
1,I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!,Intimates
1,Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink  size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly  i could even probably go to an xs  but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.,Intimates

1,This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it  but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute  but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.,Intimates

-1,I'm returning this jacket. i tried it on after it was delivered  and was happy with the weight  cut  and color  although it's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture. however  the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt  it will last very long. i actually can't get the zipper to zip at all. it's very rough and lightweight  and i'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i'll just end up breaking it. sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality.   thi,Jackets
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,Jackets
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",Jackets

-1,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first  the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono  which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve  no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,Jackets

0,It is indeed cut to the shape of a trench. however  i think retailer should rename it as it's more like wearing a cardigan. it's soft and pretty which i like. however  i wasn't convinced to buy it since i have a gazillion long black cardigans already made out of the same jersey stretch material.,Jackets

0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets

-1,I have other stevies  and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist  approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally  the cuff is sewn like that in place  and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like  a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!,Jeans

0,Oh wow no. as the previous reviewer said  much lighter than the picture! rise and inseam are as described but with the light denim they combined to make a bad look for this 40something. maybe for a younger audience who like the 90s retro vibe? the fit is true to size  i tried the 27 and it was a nice snug fit around the bum (waist 28/29  hips 36  usually a 27 or 28 in jeans  sometimes even a 29 if they're super skinny).,Jeans

-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering

0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering
0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

1,I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit  but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!,Layering
1,I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,Layering

-1,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills  stain remover  or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.,Pants
-1,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color.  i didn't have a problem with general fading  but used natural  mild stain remover (biokleen) and the pants were ruined. one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark.  cold wash and line dried. such a bummer that these pants aren't every day wearable and washable!,Pants
-1,I recommend this product  but with the following reservations.     the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper  but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes  which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.,Pants
-1,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,Pants
-1,I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body  it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.,Pants
-1,These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy  worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.     i can't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent,Pants
-1,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then  because i loved the cut of these pants  bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again  nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur,Pants
-1,As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging  i feel in love with them. the fabric was so soft - i could not wait to get them on...yeah  that was not going to happen! i could not pull them on - not even a little bit! these pants run incredibly small. i ordered them twice: once in my regular size  and again in a larger size. unfortunately  i am sized out of these beauties.,Pants
0,The top is huge! i wear an xs and am not the bustiest of women  but the top part of this romper felt like it belonged on a medium or large  even though the bottoms and waist fit perfectly. i was really disappointed  as i loved it in every other way.,Pants
0,"I do not love these pants. while the fabric is nice  they make me look rather dumpy. i highly recommend the essential taper pant instead  which has beautiful tapering legs and made me look more slender. these pants make me look like i've put on 20 pounds and they also make me look rather squat. perhaps they would look good on someone tall  but at 5' 6"" these are a miss for me!",Pants
0,Nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle. they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant  perhaps.,Pants
0,My girlfriend and i both purchased these leggings in grey. we love the color because it goes with so many things.the problem is they do not fit the same. hers ran true to size and mine ran small. i am tempted to reorder another pair to see if they fit differently.,Pants
0,"I love the style and color of this jumpsuit. i ordered a petite  and with tall shoes  it's still about 3"" too long. the side seam needs to be taken out at the bottom to hem it  so that's a pain in the rear.   also  this has a side zipper  but you step through the neckline to put it on. if any part of me was even a tiny bit larger  this would never work.   the biggest issue is that it armholes/bust gaps a lot. there should have been a dart from the armhole down towards the bust. i'm hoping to be",Pants
0,About a month ago i purchased the pilcro hypen chinos in moss size 28 petite. i loved the color and fit so much that when i saw free shipping being offered i decided to get another pair. this time i ordered the color ?pink? and of course size 28 petite. well the color really isn?t pink and unlike the moss color it does not look the color online. the color is more like salmon or apricot definitely not pink. what bothered me more is the fit. this pair was too big. it?s mind-boggling why the sizing,Pants
0,Omg - i laughed so hard after i put these on. i was so excited to get them. i ordered them in my usual 4. i got a little suspicious when i pulled them out and noticed they had an elastic waist band.  they were a little too small for me and even if they were not it's hard to imagine a world in which they didn't make me look like an oompa loompa or a hobbit! they are beautifully made and i kept looking at the picture and wondering why they don't look like that on me? i definitely have a curvier sh,Pants
0,These pants are lovely and comfortable  but they are entirely too delicate. i wore them once and nearly any time something touched them  they snagged. i was worried about it when i saw the fabric  and thought i'd give it a try  but i didn't think it would be this bad. for the price  i expect better quality. also  they run a little large- unless i pull the waist down low  it gaps in the back and these look better worn a little bit higher  closer to the natural waist. i'm usually a 4/6  28/29 in b,Pants
0,These pants are adorable as pajamas or maybe something very casual to wear to the beach  but they honestly do not seem like something that a grown woman would wear in public. they are good quality and fit nicely  but i feel like if you're over 20  they're not really flattering or especially appropriate.,Pants
1,"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual  chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",Pants

1,I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well  no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.,Pants
1,"I'm in love with this jumpsuit! i'm 39 y/old  5.5""  140lbs and ordered the 6 petite (my legs are a little challenged in the length department). it fits perfectly  and i get complimented every time i wear it. simple  yet elegant and stylish.",Pants
1,A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny  winter day. i like the longer length  to the ankle on me  pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere  boxy  cropped sweater. another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater. the fabric weight is good for winter  they do feel a little itchy at first but it's not noticeable after wearing them a short while.,Pants

1,I like this! the fabric is soft and a little less orange-looking than in the photo. i'm usually a size 12 or 14 and the size l is very small on me - as in i'd have to lose a little weight for it to look normal on me. also  it's a bit annoying that you have to undo all the little buttons in the bodice to get it on and off when going to the bathroom. but otherwise it looks cute and even has pockets!,Pants
1,"It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants  and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet  so i can't comment on durability  but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear  and these pants are very flattering and slimming  and don't pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly  and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost",Pants

-1,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail. the picture looks much cuter than in person. although it's true to size  it looks pretty baggy on. also  i thought the grey (top) and blue (bottom) were too similarly colored; more contrast would have been nice. i'm returning this item.,Shorts

-1,I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately  that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist  causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly  couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.,Shorts
-1,I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined  i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined  you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and  comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.,Shorts

0,I am so sad that this romper didn't work out. it's just way too billowy and huge. i am usually between a small and medium so i ordered this small. i'm petite and somewhat curvy and i was absolutely swimming in this romper! might look best on taller girls. i am 5 '2 and about 125-130 lbs and this was like wearing a tent. do not recommend. such a bummer because i was a believer after treading all of the great reviews!,Shorts
