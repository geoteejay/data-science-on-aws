__label__-1 "the fit on this shirt is bizarre -- it very much resembles a nursing top ( but would n't actually work for that purpose ) . the side visible in the picture is nicely draped but the other side can flap open and is completely different . i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate !"

__label__0 "unfortunately this dress ran very large on me ( please no more vanity sizing ! ) and minimized what few curves i have . my store did n't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist . it also flares out quite a bit you can see this in the catalog shot . while this was n't flattering on me it may work better on curvier figures ."

__label__0 "nice lines just a bit tight if you have larger / more muscley shoulders ."
__label__-1 "this is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area . it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area . the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves . it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what . but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it ."

__label__-1 "while you ca n't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item these photos are way off . instead of the warm charcoal i see online the pants are more of a dusty blue . the material has very little stretch and i could n't get into the size 24s . the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist . for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity ."

__label__-1 "i had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it did n't work on me . nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and did n't lay well and did n't do my bust any favors . maybe better on those less pear shaped . hopeless on me ."

__label__-1 "this is a beautiful dress . however it looked awful on me . i ordered the medium and it was huge . also i looked 7 months pregnant . not a good style for the short person ."
__label__0 "i 'm usually a 6 in dresses and the 6 here fit okay . loose but still flattering a little long for a sundress . i was unhappy with it looking a little frumpy and being so loose under the arms all my bras showed . i took it back to the store and after reading the reviews here decided to try the smaller sizes ... well multiple dresses later i ended up buying a size 2 petite ! ! ! and i 'm 5 ' 9 . the 2 reg and petite still had the loose gathering look to the top but both fit much better under the arms so tha"
__label__1 "this dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model . the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color . i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did ! perfect dress for work and going out . the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo ."

__label__-1 "it 's a rather boring tank . i thought it 'd be perfect under a cardigan for work but decided against it . the fit is boxy and does not look good on a girl with curves ."
__label__-1 "i thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt . not at all ! i 'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight . it is more fitted . if you are looking for something more comfy do n't buy . however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it ."

__label__0 "this top runs small across the top . i was amazed at the material -- polyester i am sure -- because the price was so high . it has a sheer layer underneath which i think would make it hot in the summer . i love this kind of tank but it just did not look as good as it does online ."
__label__0 "other reviews are correct . but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering . makes legs look miles long . however this fits very tight allows no room for extra tummy hips booty or thighs . i ordered a s ( i 'm usually a 4 ) - was able to get it on ( step into it from the top ) but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was . if there was an m would have definitely sized up as i really liked the look ."

__label__0 "the shape was not as nice on model seemed like a lot of extra material ."
__label__-1 "similar to others here these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash which was okay but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside . i 'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body ; ) could 've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in both the white and navy colors - navy being what looks like an ivory background with navy spots . when i received the blouse the background on the navy is actually a light grey/beige color that makes the whole top look kind of dingy . when ordering the navy version be aware that the product images do n't show the true background color on the top !"

__label__0 "i 'm keeping this top bc it was on sale but it does look a little maternity ! i wore with super skinny white jeans and 3 casual heel . i 'm short so i needed a little more height to slim me but if your tall and and slender this might work better for you ?"
__label__0 "got them in the light blue . i 'm 5 ' 0 so they 're a little long . i like the texture and they are really comfortable ! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really ca n't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top ."
__label__-1 "i love byron lars dresses and this design is on-point . the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty and the dress fits like a dream . however -- the fabric ! ! ! i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel . this is sadly going back today ."

( it seems to only come in two colors though . ) soft flowy fabric is lined with a soft inner fabric as well . super flattering for any body type !"
__label__1 "i had a hunch that this would run big based on the style and brand so ordered an xs instead of my normal s and it was perfect ! the fit on me is exactly like the model shot - swingy but still cute and falls nicely . i am 5 ' 7 128 # 34a for reference . i got the orange color and would say it is a little more on the reddish/burnt orange side than what is pictured . it 's very cute - i 'm happy to keep it at the promo price ."

__label__0 "i love cashmere love the length cowl-neck and colors however i found the yellow to be bit more vibrant in person which i liked . i 'm not sure i will keep this because it seemed to be a bit too thin for my taste . i would gladly pay a bit more for a thicker ply sweater ... i might justify this one at a sale price ."

__label__0 "i bought this shirt in white and am happy with the fact that it 's not too sheer . the back detail is great . my only complaint is that it is too long . i got the small and it fits nicely in the arms and top but it is much longer on me than on the model . i 'm 5 ' 5 tall . it does n't look great when i do a half tuck but it looks fine if i tuck it all the way in . maybe an xs would have been a better fit ."
__label__0 "i was so excited when i saw this dress ! i love this color and the poplin sleeves . i was so sad when i tried it on though the back poofed out in such a weird and unflattering way . i think it is because there is a pleat high up in the back but then it seems like it gets narrow again around the hips . strange . also the material is kind of stiff and seems poor quality . i do love the way the top and the sleeves look on me though so i am actually considering keeping it and just making it into a top"
__label__0 "as much as i had wanted this to work for me it did n't . fabric is not as soft as i had expected and quality is just bad . i purchased this online ( on sale at $ 29.95 ) and i had envisioned this to be comfy stretchy and swingy with a flow . i sent this back to the store as it did n't seem fit even at the low price ."

__label__0 "the material is soft and the pattern is pretty but it fits like a sack . it 's too bad that this was n't more form-fitting with some stretch and a zipper because its fit is just not beautiful . for tall very slender ladies this will be pretty as it is in the photo . it fit me just fine ( with a little extra room on top ) but it went right back into the bag without a thought ."

__label__1 "i have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt . it 's comfortable the fit is excellent and flattering and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion . i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets ."
__label__0 "cute in concept so large in reality . i am 5 ' 3 size 24 in jeans . i was swimming in these . i mean the seat is huge and the length of the rise is super long . do n't even try if you are a little person . long and lean yes would probably look great on you ."
__label__1 "great as a beach coverup . i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing ! ca n't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon !"
__label__1 "love this dress ! it is super-flattering and the embroidery is beautiful ."
__label__0 "i have a dress very like this from retailer 's fall line . i love it so i decided to try this one . the fabric is thinner than the other dress which is good for spring but it also seemed not such a great quality . i also did n't care for the texture . if this does n't bother you the pattern is very cute and the style is flattering . it is cute with a blazer ."
__label__0 "nice fabric very versatile but the knit top and style accentuates your bust . probably not an issue for most but if your a d or up it 's more attention than you may want ."
__label__-1 "this dress did n't work for me at all . i 'm 6ft tall 160lb i usually wear size l 8/10 but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy color is about the same as pictured also length is appropriate . dress is very thick and warm the fabric however has no stretch at all dress is very specious and shapeless . there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe"
__label__-1 "i ordered the taupe version of this tee which was a medium brown with black stripes . the fabric felt itchy and rough and was pretty sheer for not being light colored . i did n't care for the fit which was extremely boxy and wide ; from the picture i expected an a-line fit but not a wide drop with webbed underarms . i ordered 2 sizes and could have worn the smaller if i 'd kept this tee . it runs on the larger side . what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro"
__label__0 "dress runs very large . quality is great and the pockets are a great addition ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews . the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh . it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i 've every tried on at retailer . i 'm 5 ' 4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume ."
__label__1 "bought pink and cream colors on sale . arm holes on my usual size medium were large so bought smalls and like them a lot . i 'm 5 ' 9 and longer front and back worked well . fabric weave nice weight and good for summer or cooler with sweater or jacket over it ."
__label__-1 "long-time ag jeans fan . lately though i 'm finding the material is much too stretchy . i wanted a good pair of jeans . if i wanted pajama jeans i would 've ordered them . i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered ( same review there ) . so back both pairs went . it 's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted . if only they had been made out of actual jeans material ."
__label__-1 "the print and front ruffle are beautiful . the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model . it 's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse . such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in xxsp and the sweater is still very large on me . it is definitely a sweater that is supposed to hang off of your shoulders however i 'm finding that it wants to fall all the way off of me . the quality is nice . it is medium in weight . it has a cottony feeling but it not super soft . it looks way better on the model shown than in person to me . i wanted to love it but i only just like it . i think others will like this if you are looking for a fun loose look in a sweater ."
__label__-1 "this looked nothing like the picture on me . was long and very unflattering . belled out greatly at the bottom also . the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality . but overall awkward ."
__label__1 "this dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich luxurious fabric a deep neckline and a tightly cinched waist . i have a full bust and while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers for me it is a little miracle . this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size . thank you !"
__label__1 "i love these but i should have ordered the size 25 instead of my usual 26. i can wear them higher with a tight belt but they are still too long . too cute to return though ."
__label__-1 "i was really excited about this dress . i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece casual or dress up . when it arrived in the mail the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress . unfortunately it hung like that too . the material sags in places it should n't . i have a 5 ' 8 125 lb frame and i ordered an extra small and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back"
__label__-1 "ugh ! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews . i tried small medium and large on and huge huge huge boxy fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it 's way too boxy ? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful . i would try this one on before purchasing ."
__label__-1 "i bought this top in black . it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back . however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short . if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for 50-something me . i really wanted this to work but alas it went back ."
__label__1 "true to size so great fit from top to bottom . i am 5 ' 5 '' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low . it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area . it is very soft and comfortable . the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing ."
__label__0 "i first have to agree with other reviewers about the quality of this sweater : the stitch is pretty but the fabric is n't nearly as soft as i expected . it has the look and feel of a cheaper sweater . that said the fit is pretty flattering . i did n't have any problem getting the cowl over my shoulders as pictured by the model . i 've been looking for this style of sweater so i 'll probably keep it . however it really did n't meet my expectations for quality ."
__label__1 "i bought this in my usual medium and it fits great ( fitted at the shoulder loose below ) . it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories ."
__label__1 "as the title suggests i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts . i 'm slim ( sz 0 ) and on the shorter side ( 5 ' 4 '' ) but i have dramatic hips so i 've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them . i 'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did ! the fit is great and not too tight allows for a little room for ladies with hips . i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little"
__label__1 "this dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites ! ( i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering ... so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well ! ) i ordered in the 2p . i am 5 ' 4 about 120 # . it fits beautifully ... even though it 's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p ( it is no longer available though ) . but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is"
__label__0 "run large and leg is very wide . even sizing down they seemed too floppy ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim and these crops were made specifically for petites . also i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean not a skinny . the fit and sizing seems to be a little off . i ordered my regular size in this brand 27p but they were too big . sized down to a 26p . they were still too large in the waist ( seemed very stretchy ) but fit well in the legs . i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect"
__label__1 "i hated to send this dress back but my busty and curvy figure looked bigger and rounder in this dress . sent it back . it is meant for taller and more slender women ."
__label__1 "i just received this dress in petite extra small . for reference i am 57 and 118 pounds . to answer the previous reviewer 's question the regular size of this dress runs long . if you want it to look like the one in the video then order it in petite . i personally love the style and the material . however the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it ."
__label__1 "love this jacket . it 's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory . perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans while still maintaining an elegant look ."
__label__1 "i consider myself fairly busty ( 34 d ) but i did n't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium ..... i actually went with the small . the lace inset does n't give but it was n't tight at all . i love the flow of the blouse .... it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall !"
__label__0 "the fit is gorgeous but i did n't realize it was completely transparent . when it says mesh it means mesh ! i was thinking the mesh part was on the bottom . because of how it is cut high on the shoulders you ca n't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage . very cute but not practical ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this dress in the green and while the print and material were lovely the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top . the billowly bottom made it look like a bag . i am 5ft 36d and 29 waist and the size 2 fit which makes me think this runs large ! i 'll be returning this dress ."
__label__-1 "this dress looked gorgeous in the monthly catalog . ordered in hopes to wear in easter . i felt it was frumpy and just ok. color was pretty but overall ; i did n't love it like i hoped to ."
__label__0 "at 5 ' 5 ( almost ) 122lbs . i always wear a size small . however this dress runs large ( no i am not smaller than i was 6 months ago ) and it looked like a dumpy sack on me . too bad i really wanted it to fit ! it is a slightly heavier fabric than anticipated and would be an excellent travel dress . i may try the xs . . ."
__label__0 "another shirt i really wanted to love . i adore green but so few tops are made in this color . ( please make more ! ! ) however this shirt did n't work for me . i think it 's a matter of where your curves live . the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery . sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on . probably a great shirt for different body types . would love to see more green clothing ...."
__label__1 "the blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs . very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there !"
__label__1 "i purchased this dress in blue and paired it with the seychelles forward platform wedges in cognac . the fit is amazing the length is great ( i 'm 5 ' 5 and it hits me a couple inches above the knee ) and it is a great spring staple . my only issue with this dress is that is wrinkles so easily . easily fixed with a quick steam or low iron ."
__label__0 "i was disappointed with this jumpsuit . when i first saw it in the store i thought i was going to love it . when i tried it on the first issue is the fabric is too sheer . i could completely see the outline of my underwear and bra . it also runs way too big ! i know the bottom is supposed to be loose and flowy but the waist needs to be more tapered to off set that and it 's so baggy . the arm holes are also cut very low so when you lift your arms you can see most of your bra on the sides i wante"
__label__1 "this cardigan is so fun to wear . you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion ."
__label__0 "this is a gorgeous top ; however it is very sheer and see through . maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker ?"
__label__1 "i adore the tiny brand blouses ! this one is lovely and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy embroidered material very pretty indeed . this probably is equally stunning in the nude color but it does n't show well somehow online . the navy is certainly amazing and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans . i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off . the large fits me perfectly although i am a medium in most all other tops . 5.1 130 # 3"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress as the length cut and color are exactly what i 've been looking for . but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is ."
__label__1 "picked this up at the local retailer in both colors . the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought . highly recommend ."
__label__0 "i loved the idea of this dress but i find that it is n't very flattering . i think the arm holes are actually very interesting but i 'm 5 ' 5 and 135lbs and the dress made me look fat and gave me no shape at all . maybe it would look better on a different body type . the material is soft but a bit stuffy and i could tell it would give me crazy static in my hair ."
__label__1 "i saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear . however after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing so i tried it on . what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person and very soft and warm . it 's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year . i am 5'-7 138 lbs . and the medium fit perfectly though it 's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos ."
__label__1 "i ordered this dress online and did n't really know what to expect . but to my surprise it 's exactly what i had hoped it would be . the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern interesting print . the fabric does seem thin for the price . but i am not returning it . it 's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends . i wear it with beige sandals and the gray and beige look good together too ."
__label__1 "love the design and colors runs a but large through the middle"
__label__1 "i had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created . the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely . perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady . i have no idea what i 'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though ... we 'll cross that road when we come to it i guess . also - the interior seams are a bright electric blue -"
__label__0 "i fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it . but was disappointed when i received it . first was the color . i chose the green and it was n't what i thought . it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass . when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt . the color was that bad . the fit was the next problem . this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted . the top was loose and that added to the flowy"
__label__1 "lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt . i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front . i am heavy chested though so that 's how most tops fit me . i ordered the gray/black and it 's really nice . i receive lots of compliments ."
__label__1 "i do love this shirt but when it arrived it had makeup around the collar apparently from someone else who had tried it on . i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem but it did make for a poor first impression !"
__label__0 "i am a sweater girl so i was really looking forward to this cozy-looking piece . like other reviewers i found the fit to be very strange and not as pictured . i am 5 ' 1 and 107 lbs and typically wear xxsp or xsp . i ordered this in the xxsp because of the loose fit . it did not fit like the model at all . the sleeves were shorter and stuck out oddly . the length was not as long as pictured but it would have been fine for me had the sweater not also been as wide as it was long . others suggested sizi"
__label__-1 "the good : the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute . now the bad : the material is wretched . it feels damp even when it 's not ... it 's see through and unlined ... it 's scratchy and wrinkly ... and though the cut of the dress would be fine the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail . i wanted to like this but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable . i returned it as fast as i possibly c"
__label__-1 "so disappointed . i love retailer ! this was a huge disappointment . i am 5 ' 3 and 120 pounds . when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look . if i was n't so disappointed i might have laughed . this had to have been a design mistake . i 've truly never seen something so unflattering ."
__label__-1 "right out of the bag this top did n't really match the one pictured here ( it is the right top though ) . the fabric was heavy and felt damp -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd . and the fit is nothing like what 's shown on the model . the v is not fitted or nicely wrapped ( or even tacked in place ) -- it was just two loose droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged ( i 'm neither flat chested nor busty"

__label__0 "this top was really cute on someone else but not on me ... on me ti was too big and the color washed me out . the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too just not on porcelain skin ... like many tops this season it is a bit boxy but looks nice with jeans white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt . i would probably size down a bot ..."

__label__-1 "i am 5 6 ' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs . the sweater is enormous . the material is also scratchy and not soft at all . i 'm disappointed with retailer 's sizing this year . i 've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge . really disappointing ."
__label__0 "i took this too to the register thinking it was marked down to same price as another tee by the same brand . it was n't so i ended up paying way too much for a thin tee . will probably return ."
__label__-1 "these are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13 ."
__label__-1 "this top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure . i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular curvy frame . this top adds about 20lbs ."
__label__0 "1. the wide leg/crop is a cool trend . but not great on me . i 'm pretty standard in size/build : 5 ' 6 135 lbs size 4. i felt like i just looked oddly shaped with them on . 2. and maybe this is the issue : the size 27 ( my normal size in every citizen pant i own ) was about 2 whole sizes too big for me . i mean i felt great about myself . but ... wowza . 3. when i took them to the store to try on/exchange they do n't even carry them in the store ! so i just returned and will try something else ."
__label__-1 "i love the design that 's why i 'm going back for a smaller size . i bought a medium and that size was made for someone 50 lbs heavier than i. usually i 'm good at choosing my size online but not today . if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room . also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on please !"
__label__-1 "this cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer . the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap ."
__label__1 "i had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale . when i pulled it out of the package i could not believe how soft it was . literally as a cloud . think of the softest fluffiest baby blanket . also the cut is extremely flattering . i am 5 ' 7 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly flowing but not boxy . love it !"
__label__-1 "this dress is absolutely hideous on my physique . ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent . i have an athletic built am a 34d . it is going back asap ."
__label__1 "i love these shorts . i do n't understand why they are n't sold out yet ! they are buttery soft and fit great . i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size . they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even . love ! !"
__label__1 "i love this jacket . it 's easy to dress up or be casual . the black is more like a very dark grey ."
__label__-1 "i purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions . i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes no problem . well the reviews are correct . i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink . i am returning them this evening . i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank . it is made ve"

__label__1 "i could n't believe the bargain price of these leggings so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors . when they arrived i was equally pleased to see how soft cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops . also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different . the black has a vertical lined texture the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured . wearing them is going to be a pleasure !"
__label__-1 "the top was very small . i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top arm holes and it was short . also i did n't notice if it said it was sheer ( see through ) in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath ."
__label__1 "i just bought this and really think it is a great dress ! it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church . i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy . this is cute and chic yet conservative . also j got 25 % because it is black friday . thank you retailer ! ! !"
__label__-1 "i ordered these pants in my usual size ( xl ) and was shocked when i received them . the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up . i could n't keep them on so of course back they go ! too bad ! the sweater quality is great ."
__label__1 "it is a little boxy but it ? s not unflattering in my opinion . the sweatshirt material is soft the ruffles keep their shape and position and aren ? t too overwhelming on my small frame . i like the small slits on the sides they allow the sweater to drape nicely . it also hit at a flattering spot a little below the hip . 5 ? 1 ? ? 100 lbs and got the xxs petite . this fit true to size for me ."
__label__1 "this pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics . i love the color which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo . it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique . i also appreciate the wide straps which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo . the only drawback is size . i ordered my usual xs ( i am 5 ' 5 110 lbs"

__label__-1 "my perspective is as a sewer so i 'm more picky perhaps . this top is poorly made . the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece . sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric . it looks sloppy . the cut is very full ; the bottom edge measures 104 around . for my figure curvey at 5 ' 6 and 150lbs this top is not flattering it looks maternity . perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings ."

__label__0 "the cut and print of this dress is beautiful . however the armhole is way too low which is a reoccurring problem with anything sleeveless from retailer these days . please do n't drop the armholes so low most women do not want their bra completely showing every time you lift your arm !"

__label__0 "lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape . the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am . the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern . perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model . i will be returning it ."

__label__-1 "i loved these pants . they fit perfectly . and then i washed them . like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them . the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns . so sad . wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right ?"
__label__1 "this is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress . really love it . however there 's no way that model is 5 ' 10 in the photo because i 'm 4 inches shorter than that and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me . it 's really not a dress it 's a tunic . i 'm happy with it because it 's so pretty but i did think i was buying a dress . i just wore it with leggings and i 'm happy with a beautiful tunic !"

__label__-1 "i adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer . picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day . i feel as if i wasted my money ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this coat so bad . the material is lovely and it 's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off . if you have any hips forget it ( my hips are 38 ) - you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy . the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders .... like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird . but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it was n't a size thing . i bought a size medium at 5 ' 5 and 140 pounds ."
__label__-1 "i love the design of this top however it 's quality is lackluster . the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering ( at least on me ) if it had a few more inches . also it 's pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma . i will still wear it because i love it . looks great with a denim vest over it !"
__label__1 "i saw this dress in my local retailer store and am not sure why i did not try it on then but later at home it began to haunt me . i loved the colored embroidery against the black . my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that would n't take up too much room and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little . online i saw that it was available in the petite and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite"
__label__0 "i love the looks of this sweater on the model ! after receiving it it was still very pretty and stylish to look at . my problem is that i am petite and the sweater seemed to run very large . it was n't very fitted . i think the detailing in the back would look better fitted . it made me look rather dowdy and/or matronly unlike how it looks on the model . i think that was because it was just too big . i returned it ."
__label__-1 "looks like a pregnancy top . a lot gathers in front and back . added 10 pounds to me . not flattering on much longer than on the model . and the color is not white . it 's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe . i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in green in petite large . the color and knit is beautiful and the shoulders and body fit comfortably ; however the sleeves were very long for a petite . i roll them and it looks okay but would have rather had a normal petite length sleeve ."
__label__0 "wore this romper 1x and after washing the hem on one of the shorts/legs completely unraveled . if i want to ever wear it again i will have to bring it to a tailor to get fixed . unacceptable for a $ 200 product . cute design and good fit but questionable quality ."
__label__1 "the red detail at the shoulders is pretty and i liked the contrast between the red and white . the fabric is soft and comfortable . it is a sweater knit fabric more substantial than you might guess from photos . the sleeve ruffles were a little poofy for me and combined with the loose fit it made me feel a little too girl-ish . this could work for you if you are looking for a peasant style blouse with a forgiving shape and nice details but it was n't quite right for me ."
__label__1 "i got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store . we loved that this could be worn stand alone with leggings or as an over-shirt . it 's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe ."
__label__0 "i like the fabric and aesthetic of this top and really wanted to like it however i wish it were longer . i am a size small or med in all retailer clothes but even the medium felt short and clingy . however that might be because i 'm curvy with a long torso so i 'd definitely recommend trying this on rather than buying online !"
__label__1 "i think the model photo does n't do this dress justice . it 's comfortable and perfect for a summery day . i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan and of course it works well causally . i 'm busty -- d on a small frame -- but there 's not gapping . the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish ."
__label__0 "this shirt is beautiful and so soft . it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut . the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which for me defeats the purpose of this type of shirt . i am rather busty ( 34 dd ) so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off ."

__label__1 "i am super happy with this purchase . this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow . i 'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather . i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well ."
__label__-1 "so i bought this even after seeing the other reviews . because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different . this fits just as others describe . it was not flattering to me at all 52. had to go back ."
__label__-1 "so ordered online . tried this on boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes . back it goes . super cute but huge ."
__label__0 "my first complaint is this dress is pinned back so obviously in the video that when the model turns around ( not all the way ) you can see the pin in the back . that should have been a clue that this dress is n't meant to fit anyone properly if it does n't fit the model . i agree with another reviewer that the model in the still product photos sized up and up because the dress does not fit loosely in regular size nor is it that long . you have to have a longer torso to pull off the top or the fabr"
__label__1 "this skirt is not only cute but really comfy . i really like the materials it 's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way . i 'm 5 ' 2 so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist . love this skirt !"
__label__0 "i think the model is wearing a larger size per the first review . i am 5 ' 2 and 105 lbs and the xs fits about the same in length but not nearly voluminous . so you should order up if that is what you want . this will be perfect for some long summer flights instead of a wrap since the sleeves will be more convenient and i always look schlumpy rather than elegant in a shawl ! if it had some cashmere or another softer fiber i would be totally in love with it ."
__label__-1 "i just got this and could n't wait to wear it to work today . it is such a pretty designed top . unfortunately it is falling apart as i write this review . one sleeve is unraveling . there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms . am so disappointed in the quality . i 'll be sending it back when i get home ."
__label__1 "i received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it ! it does not smell nor does it itch as the other reviewer stated ... at least not for me . i was worried about the green color but it 's quite lovely . this is a keeper for me ! i am 5 ' 1 but ordered the regular xs and i am happy with the length ."

__label__0 "i am a huge fan of pilcro pants and was so excited to see them make a pair of vegan leather pants . the idea is great - leather in the front fully stretchy fabric in the back to give a fitted but comfortable look . however i could n't get past the way the seams and leather felt on my knees - really stiff and uncomfortable when you start walking around ( ca n't bend the leg all the way ; weird creasing and bunching behind the knee ) . the fit was perfect everywhere else . sadly these had to go back : ("

__label__-1 "tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece but the quality is below average for an retailer dress . it 's just a shapeless thin beach cover-up that i could 've picked up anywhere . the yellow color is so cute though . if you 're looking for a light breezy go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel this might be good for you but it 's too thin for just about anything else ."
__label__-1 "i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped . it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way . i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust . the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line . sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless . the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high ."
__label__0 "let me start this review by saying 75 % of my clothing is from retailer and i love them . my husband bought this sweater for me recently and it 's gorgeous but when i tried it on one sleeve was longer than the other . i went to the store and tried on several sweaters even in different colors and had the same issue . sometimes is was extreme sometimes is was n't as noticeable . it was noticeable to me however as i am 6 ' and sleeve length is super obvious when its too short . love the sweater as it wa"
__label__0 "i was so excited to receive this top but was immediately disappointed ! it is much thinner than it seems & it almost feels like a cheap top . it 's also see-through but i 'm not bothered by that . it has a very boxy cut which i like with slimmer bottoms . but overall i did n't care for this top & expected it to be more structured & stiff rather than flimsy & thin . it 's going back ..."
__label__1 "ca n't say about fit just yet since it is a gift ; color is soft green and versatile . finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt"
__label__-1 "this is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer . the sleeves are so weird and ugly . they get really fat at the top like a dolman sleeve but it looks really strange because they don ? t flow into the rest of the top which is very structured . it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders . this is not apparent in the model picture at all . the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri"
__label__0 "very nice material soft and feminine colors . however the waist sat higher than my natural waist and was uncomfortable . unfortunately it 's going back"
__label__1 "this is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way . this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i ca n't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots . it 's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well . love it ."
__label__-1 "this dress really was huge and not at all flattering . i do n't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture . material was nice and soft but i really do n't see how anyone could look good in this no matter what your body shape is ."
__label__-1 "this is a great dress if you do n't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples ."
__label__1 "i ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big ! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small . i 'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better . the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks amazing on-line . in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake . too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering . pattern is dizzying in person . very thin multi layer dress . should be better material and quality for this price . save your money and shipping ."
__label__1 "this is a great looking sweater . very nice quality and is a great design . can wear with many colors . love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look . nice ! ! ! ! ."

__label__-1 "i waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed . loved the skirt part of it . but the top which i guess i did n't see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides . would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool ."
__label__0 "i was so disappointed when i received this top . the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture . the back is cute but not worth the awful drab actual color ."
__label__-1 "i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy . im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest . not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver . would n't recommend it ."
__label__1 "great fit and extremely comfortable ."
__label__0 "this piece is stunning . you can dress up or down with it . my husband said wow that 's very elegant . it is very soft . thin but warm . however it came to me with numerous holes along one strip of fabric . i returned it for another . it is a very delicate fabric . the zig zag stitching may snag easily . i 'm afraid it will not wash well . definitely a hand wash item . i 'm not sure i will keep it in the end . the design i thought should be a 5 star because of the look and versitality of the item . quality"
__label__-1 "so thin and see thru it 's not even wearable in public . extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price . i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out . going back ."
__label__1 "these are really cute pants . nice flowy fabric - perfect for dressing up or down from spring to fall . the only problem for me was the sizing . i tried my usual xs/0 ( 5 ' 7 115lbs ) but they were huge - as in pulled them on without realizing there was actually a zipper opening ! i then decided to try the petitie in the xs and those fit perfectly but unfortunately they were too short . the regular length were too long and would have needed hemming but that would not have bothered me as it would have"
__label__0 "if you have muscular thighs like me these wo n't fit well . i 'm usually a size 8-fitted/10-relaxed i bought these in a large and the shins were the most relaxed part . had to return for not fitting well . but the quality of the product was nice ."
__label__1 "simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it 's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots . very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways . i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i 'm sure the regular would 've been fine . looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram ."
__label__1 "i got this on sale . i sized up from my normal 10 to a 12 based on reviews . the 12 is too large for me and i 'd need a 10 which is sold out . the straps are very long . i think even if i sized down i 'd have to have them altered . also the dress i got is missing the bottom button . sending back . i 'm not too sad i ordered the pink pippa swing dress with the same order and love it ."
__label__-1 "when i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments . it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning . after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable . i have to return it and am so disappointed . sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason ."
__label__1 "beautiful lace shell ! great with jeans for a night out or with a skirt for a more formal affair . good quality not itchy ."
__label__0 "i should have paid more attention to the reviews of this sweater before ordering . although the material looks soft and cozy in the photo it 's very scratchy and uncomfortable . i was also hoping the opening of the collar would be a little wider which would have been more flattering on me . i never wear turtlenecks of any kind so i took a chance on this . i 'm sure others will look fabulous in this sweater and may be happy with it if they do n't mind the texture . i 'm sending it back ."

__label__0 "i really wanted to like this but like other reviews say the knit fabric pills easily and i do n't think the tank feels or looks as good as it would were it cotton . a good deal on sale but i do n't think it will hold up very long . i got the teal/white as black/white and coral/navy were sold out ."
__label__0 "i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black . the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything . i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it 's thin and see through . if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it !"
__label__0 "i love this fabric and the design details of this top . but i am only 5 ' 3 and this top ends above my waist ! shoulders and sleeves fit perfectly and the neck and back details are very flattering . i ended up keeping the shirt because i love the fabric so much but i am trying to find a way to wear this shirt with how short it is . tucking in or wearing with high-waisted bottoms are all i can figure out for someone without a perfectly flat tummy ."
__label__0 "i was so excited when this dress arrived today . as other reviewers have mentioned the fabric is lovely soft and drapey and it feels great on . it felt great that is until i looked in the mirror . while the dress fit fine i have a large bust and the fabric stretched across the bust causing the print to appear washed out across the bust . not a good look . sigh . another return ."
__label__0 "i knew there was a problem when my dress arrived and the small fit perfectly when i was 9 months pregnant ... i even bought a small even though i normally wear medium i bought it for family pictures once my daughter was born but it made me look like i was still pregnant even though i had already lost all the baby weight in 3 weeks . it is a beautiful dress though and may try to get it altered to see if that works"

__label__-1 "i really loved this in the catalog . the fabric and details are very pretty . however it 's a lot of fabric without much form . my husband suggested it for maternity ( not realizing it has fitted slip ) . not for curvy/ hourglass . had to send it back ."
__label__1 "i had to order this dress three times to get the correct size . ordered a petite which worked great . i really like the dress now that i found the size that fits best . love the color ! perfect for so many occasions church special events and dinner out . great with flats and wedges . i know i will be wearing it lots this summer . did i mention i love the color ! worth repeating ."
__label__0 "great looking shirt that i bought for my wife but poor quality . the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off . first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off . when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug . its really too bad because it looks great otherwise ."
__label__0 "the sweater is very very warm . it looks okay not the best but not bad . i had high expectations so was disappointed to see no closure i do n't wear sweaters and jackets without closures . i like having the option of closing buttons if it gets any colder . so i am sending it back ."
__label__0 "very cute shirt well made nice detail but a little long for my taste but i did keep it"
__label__1 "the sweater is as cute in person as it is online ."
__label__1 "i love this skirt . it does run a little small i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist but still works . i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned . i 've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it . i also work with kids and they all love it as well ."
__label__1 "wonderful dress ! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me ! normally this sort of dress would n't fit with it failing me in the bust but it fit quite well . in most cases i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust but with it then too large in the shoulders or the dress would have run so small i would n't have been able to button it in most places . i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit but the quality as well . as described by other reviewers it"
__label__0 "i really like the pilcro serif style but the stet style does not work for my body . will have to return ."
__label__1 "i love this . it is perfect . it is sheer but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great . so glad antro finally has something with a waist ! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail . i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one !"
__label__1 "this is such a lovely top and i am so happy i was able to snag it on sale ! trust the other reviewers that it does run small ! i am normally a 0 or 2 on top and i got the 4 - and it 's a bit snug ! it is very fitted below the bust but that 's what makes it look so nice on . i would definitely recommend but know that sizing is off ."
__label__-1 "the quality of the garment is high -- a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern but the cut was totally off for me . i 'm usually an xs/s and was swimming in the xs . the arms in particular were huge and drapey and the whole thing just hung on me ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 120 lbs ) ."
__label__-1 "even on sale this was just too pricey for what it is which is a glorified tank . i liked the straps but it hangs very wide off your chest ."
__label__0 "love the color cut and weight ( its like a fleece-weight coat but longer and more appropriate for an office . ) within two wears one of the buttons popped off . within three wears one of the back shoulder seams had split . this coat is lovely but shoddily made . worth it with a discount and if you know how to hand-sew because minor repairs will be in your future . it is so beautiful but not worth full price at this build quality ."
__label__0 "i received this skirt today and was very disappointed . i do n't know what i expected but it is not as i thought . even though the quality is very good and the fit is true to size i may return it . the fabric of the skirt is just too busy at least for me . i am just uncertain and even though i have many tops the colors are just not matching . white looks better than any colored top with this particular print . i am going to try it on one more time and make a definite decision ."
__label__1 "this blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great . silk is always light and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt . i 'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks ."
__label__1 "i bought this shift dress for a black & plaid nye event and it fit the bill perfectly for a cold winter 's night . looks great with tights and boots has pockets and dresses up nicely . i like a good shift at this point in the holiday season -- leaves room for that last bit of seasonal eating and drinking . looking forward to wearing this through the winter months ."
__label__-1 "the review above titled so disappointed could n't have said it any better . the dresses from last year are perfect . i probably wear them at least once a week . i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year . i 'm generally an xs or s in dresses ( however i have xxs from last year 's version ) and the xs in this one is lifeless . it 's heavy hot does n't have the same nice shape as last year . i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres"
__label__0 "i bought this sweater online and was surprised by how thick and fluffy it is . this is a warm and cozy sweater more bulky than oversized . pattern has a comic book-style art look . it has raglan sleeves and a boxy cut and narrows a bit at the waist . cute warm sweater for winter -- wore with an undershirt ."
__label__1 "these are great wear- anywhere shorts . they are not too long and not too short . they are very soft and comfy . i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps . i will still keep the 6 's for wearing around the house ."
__label__1 "very cute plaid button down that is tts ; i am busty and the l fit just right with enough room without the buttons doing the splits like most shirts . the dainty details & material of this button down makes this stand out from other button downs that look like flannels -- which this is not . it is woven of a fine material enough to be able to wear a camisole underneath it is not a flannel shirt . colors are vibrant and the purple in the back really is quite attractive . happy i got this on sale & sale"
__label__-1 "pretty design but when i tried it on the fabric was thin and delicate . i do n't think it would last long with much wear . too bad . if the fabric were sturdier it 'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets ."
__label__-1 "online this looks like a great sweater . i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured . in fact i 'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer . unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier ."
__label__1 "i really love everything about this cardigan . the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot the color is highly versatile it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm and my favorite part is that it is long . i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans . the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to"
__label__1 "following another reviewer 's advice i ordered up to an xl . it 's huge . stick with your normal size or go down one . it 's a one of a kind piece . soft lightweight yet cozy and adorable . sadly have to return mine ."
__label__1 "i am a shopper .... i shop a lot . this is one of my favorite dresses of all time ! so unique and as others have said like a piece of art ! the fit is tight through the middle but that 's what makes it look so perfect . i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike . i love it !"
__label__-1 "great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it"
__label__1 "i bought this tee becasue of the color and brand ( my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux ) and am so pleased . the color is great for a fall layering piece and the fabric is so soft .... amazing ! it may be better for layering the fabric is very thin ."
__label__1 "i did not have the same experience as the other reviewers . found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink ( made to look worn - so may not be your thing ) . fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me . long enough for leggings but great with jeans booties and long necklace ( needs accessorizing ) . the aged look may not be for all but overall i love it ."
__label__0 "this dress was cute but the fit was not quite right . the bottom half fit well but the top half was a little loose . it was wearable but i was worried after wearing for a few hours it would stretch out even more and look frumpy . like other reviewers have said this dress really needs a belt to bring it together . i ended up returning it because i did n't love it ."
__label__1 "i just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is ! i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work out with friends or for date night ! perfect summer tank ! comfortable and flattering ! a great addition to my wardrobe ! it fit true to size for me !"
__label__-1 "i 'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses especially the petite xs maxis . this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made . it was humongous and gave me no shape . even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same . i 'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess -- which also makes no sense because it 's the petite size . do not buy . i 'm very upset i have to pay the $ 5.95 return fee since i ordered this ."
__label__0 "it made me look extra thick in the middle -- could pass for maternity wear . pretty colors . fabric is fine . it 's just too shapeless and not flattering on me . i 'm 5'11 and it was also on the short side for me . even if it fit better probably too short for my age ( 40s ) ."
__label__-1 "this top is absolutely beautiful . the fabric is great the cut is nice etc ... however the buttons are too big for the button loops which do not have any stretch . it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on . once i had it on i left it unbuttoned . i returned it . ( if you ca n't live without it you could put smaller buttons on it . ) too pricey for a non-functioning top . too bad ."
__label__-1 "this picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off . they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture . they also run very small ."
__label__1 "i am always looking for a shirt that 's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt ( running after a 1 year old i need comfort ) . i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple ( which i think it said was blue for some reason ) . the material is nice and the cut is feminine ."
__label__-1 "this top is too boxy and has too much going on . it should have no buttons or different ones ."
__label__0 "if you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body . this does n't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist . it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest . also i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons as several were off some of the dresses ."
__label__1 "i ordered down a size based on other reviews . i am 5 ' tall 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit . i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors . my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone ."
__label__-1 "the photos online make it look like a comfortable relaxed lightweight early fall/spring cardigan . when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no shimmer as far as i can tell . i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out but it did n't work . it looks too rumpled and i do n't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed ."
__label__-1 "i wanted these culottes to work so much ! the fabric is gorgeous but the size i ordered did n't fit . i 'm normally a size 28 in pants and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area . not what i wanted it to be . had to return them unfortunately ."
__label__-1 "as a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs ! they are amazing for dressing up ( or sassing up ) and outfit . i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them . however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor . after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat ! i really do n't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved . i 'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants !"
__label__-1 "this blouse has a very cute style . the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer ? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami . it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size ."
__label__-1 "this over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy . i knew it would fit big but the neck is overly bulky . the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture . fits a little larger ( on me ) than on the model . i 'm petite so it overwhelmed me ."
__label__0 "two strikes against this top and its going back . first the white top is a light weight cotton ... and it does not come with a lining or shell underneath . just know you will need one . i would have been able to get over that fact since i have tanks i could have worn but second strike is that it wrinkles . alot . it came out of the shipping box with the type of wrinkles that i know will get way worse after washing . i am not interested in ironing anything . for this price i would n't have expected b"
__label__0 "the dress is adorable and has a very nice fabric and a slip that goes underneath . it was just too big for me even as a swing dress ."
__label__-1 "i have always bought interesting pretty wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer . now the dresses are just retro funky . sad to see ."
__label__1 "saw these in the store and had to have them . i wear them rolled up . they are lightweight . whenever i wear them i want to smile . the birds with hats are so funny . i wear them to run errands have worn them when flying etc . ca n't say enough good things about these pants . they wash well no ironing needed ."
__label__1 "i love this ! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up ! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch . i purchased the large but could 've gotten away with a slender fit in medium . i am 5 ' 4 170 lbs ."
__label__-1 "these would have been the perfect black pants ! great cut love the wide band in the front true to size quality construction . but a zipper in the back ? ! ! ! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up . perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on . sending them back since i do n't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need ."
__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it . i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available . the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed . however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky . i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering ."
__label__0 "the sleeve detail is cute and well done . the fabric is nice quality but the body of the shirt really does n't have any shape ."
__label__0 "i am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and yikes right out of the package knew they '' d be way to small . they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful . i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for . i 'll update this review when they arrive . other than the size issue they were just as pictured/expected ."
__label__0 "i do n't have a lot of pink or lavender in my wardrobe but any time i do try a shade like this on i always think it compliments my skin tone and hair color . i generally wear a mauve-ish or coppery eye shadow and the color of this shirt looks beautiful against that makeup too . unfortunately i just do n't find the shape of the top to be flattering . it 's really long so the way the model has it partially tucked looks best but i 'm not really thin like her and i have a larger chest ... it just does n't"
__label__1 "this dress rules . so comfy and versatile . flattering cut . great with flats wedges booties boots with tights . easily my new fav . runs large . i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it . no button gap either i am a 34c ."
__label__-1 "i thought the photo of these pants was so cute . when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were . i held the waist up to my chest just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground . i am not a short woman ! i ordered a 14 i am 5 ' 6. i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size ."
__label__-1 ".... that 's what i look like wearing this dress . a sad sad sack . the fabric is less than ideal and there is no shape to speak of . i love that it has pockets but that 's about it . there was just way too much fabric for a petite person . this dress has got to be good on someone sadly that person was not me ."
__label__0 "glad i got this on sale . it is more yellow than the photo & short . it is also heavy with a sueded interior . would have given more stars if it was less boxy & longer ."
__label__0 "i 'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l . the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide . there are snaps to make them tighter but it does n't do much . i do like the embroidery . it 's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better ."
__label__0 "these jeans fit perfectly . however the distress at the knee was a bit too distressed for my taste . i would recommend these jeans for a younger demographic ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt . it is great quality and hangs perfectly ! please make more colors in this one . i would buy all of them ! !"
__label__1 "i love this shimmer tank-in both colors ! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank . i think you can never go wrong with sparkles especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit . the straps on this tank are not adjustable and if you are large chested i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank . i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh"
__label__0 "i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i do n't know how i would use this top . i do n't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops ( if people see my bra slightly so be it ) but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top . i returned it and was sorry to have to do that ."
__label__0 "i loved this dress and was hoping to keep it . but for an a-lign dress it was not roomy enough in the hips and the waist was baggy . i think this dress would look great on a very very slim build with straight hips ."
__label__-1 "these pants are more like 9 not 10. i was very dissappointed . the color is great and so is the fabric . if you look more closely at the model the pants do n't fit her either ! ! they are too small ! i have n't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight . i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer"
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewers ; this sweater was strangly shaped in the waist in an unflattering way . the rest of it was beautiful though . looks too much like maternity even in a petite xs so it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "this shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected . had to send it back ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this set but sadly it just did n't fit as i had hoped . the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy . returned ."
__label__0 "i thought this top had shimmery dots that is what it looks like in the picture . but when it arrived it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top . the dots are polka dots . the embroidery at the v-neck does n't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person . the top runs true to size but the fit did n't feel as perfect for me . i am sending it back . i needed a more shimmery top ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to like this shirt but it does n't seem to be of that great of quality and is much more sheer than indicated in the photographs . the shirt is very clingy and does n't hang well . i sent it back"
__label__1 "this top is my new favorite . i ordered it on a whim and oh boy am i glad ! ! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me and once it arrived i could n't wait to put it . once i put it on i could n't wait to show it off ! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings shorts and sandals . such an easy classic simple shirt that i will probably wear too much ."
__label__0 "i really like the style of this top and it 's delicate but well made but i wish it were longer and less boxy . it 's nice that it comes with a separate cami to layer but the cami is very cropped . when i raise my arms you can see a lot of midriff ( and the top is see through so a layer underneath is necessary ) . a longer cami probably would n't work because the top is also very short . i 'm 5 ' 0 '' with an average torso length and ordered the xxs petite . also you would have to cut the tag off if you d"
__label__1 "these jeans are great . the rise is perfect ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work . the fabric is gorgeous but the fit was very unflattering . it 's too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes . i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise . in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric could n't compensate for the very unflattering fit ."
__label__-1 "like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large . i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so wide -- much wider than any standard wide leg pant i 've owned . sadly had to return ."
__label__1 "i love these jeans ! i really like the way they fit and have n't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have ."
__label__-1 "loved the fit and colors but the fabric is very thin and see-thru . i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible . it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to ."
__label__1 "this dress makes me looks curvy thin and sexy ! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style . this one was a winner . i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite . i 'm 5 ' 5 130 ( 32dd ) sz4 fit perfect . the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself . it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you 'll love this dress !"
__label__0 "this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice . the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down . my normal 4 was big everywhere and the 2 was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else . the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just did n't work for me . maybe better for someone better endowed ?"
__label__0 "i got this 25 % off before christmas . i immediately started wearing it thinking it would be a staple . i like the swing shape ; the shape feels just right - not too baggy . but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals collects lint like crazy and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times . also there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area ( as you can see in retailer 's picture ) . it looks out of place in person . i 'm left loving the s"
__label__-1 "i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it . i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it . the fabric is made of cheap poly that 's shiny thin and clingy . it shows every lump and bump you have . the zipper at the back wo n't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump . the sewing and hemline is uneven . there was n't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"
__label__-1 "i got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy . the prior reviews stated it was warm and cozy and not itchy at all but i found it to be uncomfortably so . the dress was true to size for me and the length was good . i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough . the material reminded me of mohair ."
__label__-1 "i love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering . the neck line fits a little weird . too bad . color was nice though . i returned the top ."
__label__1 "i have this tank in all colors ... it is superb for layering ... comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline ... and it 's long enough !"
__label__0 "the jumpsuit is very pretty but it 's definitely not meant for women who are on the curvier side or shorter . plus it sort of looks like pajamas on . i am 5 ' 7 and i wanted to to look similar to the model in the picture but it comes down to my ankles so it would look best on taller/thin woman ."
__label__1 "got this dress in the blue and cream and it 's gorgeous . i love that it 's work and date night appropriate but so comfy . i am 5 ' 4 but have very short legs so it 's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that does n't drag on the ground . this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels . i got the small and it fits great . the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some"
__label__-1 "completely oversized top size medium was swimming on me ..... boxy baggy shapeless -- what more can i say ? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned ."
__label__-1 "i was extremely disappointed when this arrived . it 's nothing like the red color shown rather it 's a very dull reddish color . as other reviews have suggested it is very thin and runs large . i have to return ."
__label__1 "i bought this top about 3 weeks ago & love it ! i like it because it 's better than a plain t-shirt so it 's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping . i like the material and the length i 'm 5 ' 8 and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short . i wash it and hang it to dry no shrinking or pilling so far ! i am ordering this in at least two more colors !"
__label__-1 "this tank is not very flattering . there is a lot of fabric it 's very boxy & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey . i even sized down and it 's still just wide . i 'm returning : ("
__label__-1 "the dress is just ok. i can not imagine having paid full price for this . i got it for florida vacation . i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained ! ! ! ! cant get it out . thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like . sending back"
__label__-1 "i really loved this top . however i could n't get it on . i tried on a medium ( my usual size . ) it 's not that it was too small . something else is wrong with it . the large was way too big . too bad i really wanted this look ."
__label__1 "it 's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i ca n't wait for cooler weather . i tried it on with skinny jeans and it 's darling . love how it 's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum . perfect for leggings . nice slim but not tight fit ."
__label__0 "i chose this dress to try to flatter an hourglass figure but was disappointed . the fabric is a beautiful soft fine silk but unforgiving . the cut is not truly a wrap and with a fixed thin elastic waistband was too short waisted for me . while the model looks elongated the thin line under my bust created two poofy sections ... not flattering at all . while i was drawn to the shape for my body type it may be better suited to another . happy hunting !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love these but the zipper is extremely short and they were not flattering on my thicker thighs and large behind . the fabric is so soft however and the color is great . would work on a less curvy woman !"

__label__0 "i 'm usually an xs for most retailer dresses and shirts . i ordered up per other reviews and got a small . the small fits comfortably around my waist . the chest area is not made for large chests . my 34ds were barely contained . sad to say i wo n't be keeping the dress . the layers fabric and colors are truly pretty but the design/fit is disappointing ."
